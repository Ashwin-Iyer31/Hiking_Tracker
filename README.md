# Hiking_Tracker
Building an Arduino Based Hiking Tracker using sensors.<br>
1.BMP280 Module. Gives us Pressure, Temperature and the Altitude.<br>
2.OLED display<br>
3.ADXL345 accelerometer. Gives the components of accelerations in the all the three axes.<br>
4.HMC5883 magnetometer. Gives magnitude of magnetic field in the three axes. Used to get the compass heading, azimuth angle and many others.<br>
